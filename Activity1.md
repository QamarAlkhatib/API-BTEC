# Investigating APIs

• Explain API types and the benefits of APIs, and analyse the differences between API and SDK.

### Explain API types

- There are 4 types of web APIs:

    1. Public APIs:Any outside developer or business can utilize a public API because it is open and available. A company that develops and offers a public API will have a business model that includes sharing its applications and data with other companies.

    2. Partner APIs: A partner API is a tool for facilitating business-to-business transactions that is only available to a small group of outside developers or API consumers. For example, if a company wishes to share customer data selectively with outside CRM businesses, it can utilize a partner API to connect the internal customer data system with those external partners — no other API use is allowed.

    3. Internal APIs: An internal (or private) API is designed to connect systems and data within the company. An internal API, for example, might link an organization's payroll and HR systems.

    4. Composite APIs: Composite APIs are made up of two or more APIs that work together to create a series of connected or interdependent activities. Composite APIs can be useful for addressing complex or closely linked API behaviors, and they can occasionally outperform individual APIs in terms of speed and performance.

### Explain the benefits of APIs

- Increases productivity: APIs are a valuable tool for accelerating development. Instead of designing solutions from the ground up, developers can use APIs to swiftly apply existing functionality.

- Saves costs: The opportunity to save money is one of the most significant advantages of APIs for businesses. Using APIs to construct applications is a wonderful method to cut expenses because they greatly reduce development work.

- Improves connectivity and collaboration: As organizations adopt new applications at unprecedented speeds, separate and siloed environments emerge, obstructing communication and connectivity. Many businesses wind up with disparate systems that can't easily share data and functions.

### Analyze the differences between API and SDK

- API stands for “Application Programming Interface”. An API allows two platforms to communicate more easily. This is accomplished by allowing third-party developers to use its proprietary software. The API solution's developers can then allow their own consumers to use the service or services supplied by the API solution indirectly.

- SDK stands for "Software Development Kit". SDK refers to a package of software development tools for a certain platform, which typically includes building blocks, debuggers, and a framework or group of code libraries, such as a set of operating system-specific functions (OS).
