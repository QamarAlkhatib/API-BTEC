# Testing of the application

â€¢ **Perform a white box and black box testing for the developed application, document the results**

* **White box Testing:**

In this section I'm going to test my API server Result code and provide you with results.

* First of All This is my server side Code:

![Server](img/server.png)

* In the first 4-11 lines of code, I've downloaded the required libraries and started to use them.

* In Line 13 & 14 I have created modules for each Weather and Movie Api so to make to code cleaner and reusable.

* In lines 16-19 I've created 4 Routes some of them for testing and the other for getting the required data from the API. So let's test them:

1. **First Route** (```server.get('/', homeRouteHandler);```)

![First Route](img/firstRoute.png)

And it's working ðŸ’¯

2. **Not found Route** (```server.get('*', notFoundHandler);```)

![404 Route](img/notFound.png)

And it's working ðŸ’¯

In this section I will test Weather and movie Route with their Code.

1. **Weather Route** (```server.get('/weather', weatherRouteHandler);```

* Code Implementation:

![Weather Code](img/weather.png)

* Testing The Route if it's return the required Data for specific city: 

![Weather Route](img/weatherTesting.png)

And it's working ðŸ’¯


2. **Movie Route** (```server.get(''/getMovie', getMovieHandler);```

* Code Implementation:

![Movie Code](img/movie.png)

* Testing The Route if it's return the required Data for specific city: 

![Movie Route](img/movieTesting.png)

And it's working ðŸ’¯
